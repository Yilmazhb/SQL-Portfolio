# SQL-Portfolio
Welcome to my personal SQL portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects and queries I've worked on.


# About me
I enjoy working with data. Over the years, I have continuously developed my skills in database design and optimisation, writing complex queries, and using powerful SQL functions to extract meaningful insights from data. My portfolio demonstrates my SQL expertise and shows that I successfully master real-world data challenges.
